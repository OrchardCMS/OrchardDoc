There are currently two builds configured: "Continuous Builder" that runs on every check-in and "Full Build" that runs nightly. They are currently identical but eventually the nightly will also run functional tests.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage data is being generated with each run of both builders. The code coverage data can be viewed by clicking the "Code Coverage" tab of the project or by going into the artifacts tab and downloading the source and coverage zips that can then be used from the [NcoverExplorer](http://www.kiwidude.com/blog/2007/09/ncoverexplorer-v140.html) to explore code coverage to the level of the line of code.
