After you create a Web site in Orchard, you will need to add to pages for your content.
This topic shows how to create a new web page, add content using Orchard's rich-text editor,
and publish the page to your web site.

# Creating a New Page

In the Admin Panel under **Content**, click **Create Page**.
The **Create Page** settings are displayed, as shown in the following image.

Using the **New Page** menu entry, you can do the following:

* Give your new page a title.
* Add a search-engine-friendly address for your page (permalink)
* Set the new page as the home page for the web site.
* Add content using the rich-text editor.
* Add content tags. 
* Indicate whether to show the page on the main menu.
* Allow comments from users to be posted to the page.
* Assign an owner for the page.
* Save and publish the page to the site.

## Permalinks

A permalink is a URL that points to this page indefinitely and is less susceptible to "link rot"
(links that become unavailable).
A suggested permalink based on the page title is automatically provided when you enter the text box.
You can accept the one provided or change it as needed.

## Content Tags

A content tag assigns a content category to this page.
For example, a page about famous fiction authors might have the following tags:
authors, fiction, and books. After the page is published, a list of tags assigned
to the page is displayed below the body of the content.
By clicking on  a tag, the user can find all of the pages on your web site that have the same tag assigned.

## Show on Main Menu

If you want a link to this page to appear on the main menu, select the **Show on main menu** check box.
When this option is selected, the **Menu text** box will be displayed and
you can enter the text to display on the main menu.

## User Comments

> Comments are not enabled by default on pages. To enable them, go to `Content -> Content Types`
and edit the `Page` content type, then add the `Comments` part.

To enable users to post comments on the page, select the **Allow new comments** check box.
A form will be added to the bottom of the page for user comments.
The following image shows the form that is added to the published page.
