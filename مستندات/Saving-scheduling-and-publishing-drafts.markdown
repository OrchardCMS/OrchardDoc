> This topic has been updated for the Orchard 1.0 release.

Orchard lets you save a page as a draft or publish it to your web site. When you publish a page, you can either publish immediately or specify a time when the page should be published. The options for saving or publishing a page are available at the bottom of the **Create Page** page.

## Save a Draft Option
When you want to save a page but do not want the page to be visible to visitors, you can save the page as a draft. You can continue working on the file until it is ready to be published. In the **Manage Content** page, you can see the files that are currently saved as drafts.

A draft is listed as **Not Published** and you can use the links to publish, edit, or remove the page. Clicking the **Publish** link immediately changes the draft to a published page, and visitors will be able to see it immediately.

## Publish Now Option
To publish a page immediately, click **Publish Now**. For a draft page, click the **Publish** link in **Manage Content**. In the **Manage Content** page, you see the files that are published.

You can click links to view, unpublish, edit, or remove the page. Clicking **Unpublish** immediately turns the published page into a draft.

## Publish Later Option
You can schedule the publication of a page for a future time by setting a date and time, and clicking the **Publish Later** option.

The page will remain as a draft until the publication date and time. No further action is needed to publish the page.

In the **Manage Content** page, you can see the date and time the draft is scheduled to be published.
