> **ARCHIVED**

# Requirements

* Do not couple authentication to membership and profile data
* Ability to plug-in and combine multiple authentication schemes (internal AD, OpenID, etc.)
* Must enable creation of roles by administrators and modules
* Must be able to store custom and extensible information about users
* Ability for areas to extend user profiles
* Allow administrators to set-up user permissions in a scalable manner (adding more users and features do not result in non-linear growth of workload for the administrator)
* Allows modules to expose permissions
* Permission checking logic can be replaced

# Non goals

* ACL-type of permission system with allow/deny and priorities
* Setting permissions at the content item or instance level

# Scenarios

## A user can log into the application using his existing OpenID account

## A user can create a new user account

This should include a default captcha mechanism and provide extensibility points to replace it.

## An administrator can create a new user account

The account verification is bypassed in this case.

## A user can access and modify all his profile information

This is by law in many countries.

This includes subscriptions, etc.

## A user can delete his account

## An administrator can create new roles and assign users to roles

## A module author can add new roles and profile properties

## An administrator can manage user membership in groups

## An administrator can modify a user's profile

## An administrator can delete or ban a user

## User creation can be configured to require validation and/or confirmation

## A user can recover a lost password

If not using OpenID.

## An administrator can personalize automatic e-mail messages to the users

Messages include welcome message (with or without approval), approval notices, password recovery, account activation, account banned or account deleted.

## A module can expose permissions

A module exposes what operations can be configured to be allowed or denied to specific groups.

## An administrator can configure what groups are allowed to perform operations

# Default roles

Orchard comes installed with some default roles. New packages should provide default permission settings for those default roles to minimize the administrator's workload when adding a new package to the system.

Those roles are:

* Anonymous user (cannot be removed)
* Authenticated user (cannot be removed)
* Owner (cannot be removed, and is dynamically determined based on the object being verified)
* Administrator (cannot be removed)
* Author (typically creates new contents and can manage their own)
* Editor (can modify and publish contents created by authors)

# Permissions

As part of our initial implementation of the permission system, we are retrofitting the following permissions into the existing Orchard packages.

## Administration UI

Default permissions are:

Permission                                 | Anon. | Authentic. | Owner | Admin. | Author | Editor
------------------------------------------ | ----- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------
Access the administration UI               | No    | No         | Yes   | Yes    | Yes    | Yes

## User/Role/Permission editing

Default permissions are:

Permission                                 | Anon. | Authentic. | Owner | Admin. | Author | Editor
------------------------------------------ | ----- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------
Manage permissions                         | No    | No         | Yes   | Yes    | No     | No
Create & manage users                      | No    | No         | Yes   | Yes    | No     | No
Create & manage roles                      | No    | No         | Yes   | Yes    | No     | No
Assign users to roles                      | No    | No         | Yes   | Yes    | No     | No

> **Note:** the site owner not only has this permission by default but it also cannot be revoked from him, which is a special case.

# Error messages

When an operation can't be performed due to a permission issue, the user gets the following message if he's not authenticated:

"You are not allowed to perform this operation. Please log into the site and try again."

If he's authenticated:

"You are not allowed to perform this operation. Please contact the site administrator if you think this is an error."
