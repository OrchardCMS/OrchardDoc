# Security patch recommended for all versions of Orchard

## Background

A persistent [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) vulnerability has been discovered by Paris Zoumpouloglou , [Project Zero](http://projectzero.gr/en/) in the _Users_ module that is distributed with the core distribution of the CMS. 

The issue potentially allows elevation of privileges by tricking an administrator to execute some custom crafted script on his behalf.
The version of Orchard affected by this issue are 1.7.3, 1.8.2 and 1.9.0. Version below 1.7.3 are not affected.
To mitigate the vulnerability, don't click links in the users management page that appear to contain HTML.

## Action Required

* Apply the patch for your version or update to Orchard 1.9.1

We are releasing a patch file for versions 1.7.3 to 1.9.1 that can be applied on top of a running instance of Orchard. 
The archive for each of these patches contains a Modules folder that has the right structure to be copied into the root directory of an Orchard site. 
If you are using a source version, you need to copy the contents of the zip file into src/Orchard.Web.

You can find patches for all other previous versions here <https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/releases/tag/1.9.1>
