Build: 1.8

Published: 03/28/2014

How to Install Orchard
----------------------

To install Orchard using Web PI, follow these instructions:
<http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Installing-Orchard>.
Web PI will detect your hardware environment and install the application.

Alternatively, to install the release manually, download the Orchard.Web.1.8.zip file.

<http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Manually-installing-Orchard-zip-file>

The zip contents are pre-built and ready-to-run. Simply extract the contents of the Orchard
folder from the zip contents to an IIS virtual directory (or site root) and then point your
browser to the site. You can also just extract to a local folder and open the Orchard
folder in Visual Studio or WebMatrix as a web site (but not as a web application).
Please make sure you have a machine key
<http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Setting-up-a-machine-key>
or you may experience frequent disconnections.

What file to download?
----------------------

If you just want to use Orchard and don't care about the source code, Orchard.Web.1.8.zip
is what you want to use, preferably through the WebPI instructions.
Do not attempt to build the WebPI version in VS. Use the full source if you want to use VS.

If you want to take a look at the source code or want to be able to build the application in Visual Studio,
Orchard.Source.1.8.zip is fine.

If you want to setup a development environment for patch or module development,
you should clone the repository by following the instructions here:
<http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Setting-up-a-source-enlistment>

Branches are described here: <http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Developer-FAQ#Whatarethedefaultanddevbranches?WhichoneshouldIbeusing?>

What's new?
-----------

Orchard 1.8 fixes bugs and introduces the following changes and features:

* Migration to Microsoft .NET 4.5
  * Upgrade project targets
  * Remove unnecessary Medium Trust support code
  * Define 4.5 framework in web.config files
  * Erik ([erik_oppedijk](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/erik_oppedijk)) owns this contribution
* Upgrade ASP.NET Web Stack to newest versions
  * ASP.NET MVC 5.1
  * WebAPI 2.1
  * Razor 3.1
* Put back the List module with improved functionalities
  * The goal is to be able to use it to mimick the Blogs module
  * Sipke ([sfmskywalker](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/sfmskywalker)) owns this contribution
* Performance improvements by unleashing the power of the document db architecture built in Orchard
  * Sebastien ([sebastienros](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/sebastienros)) owns this contribution
  * Multi-tenancy improvements
* Calendar support
  * Daniel Stolt ([Decorum](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/Decorum)) owns this contribution
* Jobs Queue module (done)
  * Orchard.JobsQueueing
* Templates module (done)
  * Orchard.Templates
* Business Caching modules
  * Orchard.Caching
* Orchard.Email
  * The messaging infrastructure has been deprecated and replaced by a simpler one. As part of this change you can now define the email templates directly in shapes. 
  * The SMTP settings are read from the web.config file by default if available.
* Azure Media Services has been contributed by Microsoft Open Technologies and provides a seamless integration with the Media module
  * Orchard.Azure.MediaServices
* Orchard.Azure:
	* `PlatformConfiguration` (static class to read settings from `CloudConfigurationManager`) is gone. Its place is taken by an injectable dependency called `IPlatformConfigurationAccessor` and the old implementation's logic is moved to the `DefaultPlatformConfigurationAccessor` class, which was then extended to look for settings among the `ConnectionStrings` too.
	* These changes are reflected throughout the `Orchard.Azure` module, though the Azure database cache's behavior (`AzureCache*` classes) is not affected by `IPlatformConfigurationAccessor` implementations other than `DefaultPlatformConfigurationAccessor` due to certain NHibernate limitations.
	* Added a new setting called `Orchard.Azure.Media.StoragePublicHostName` which makes it possible to override the public host name when using Azure storage.
	* `Orchard.Azure.Media` and `Orchard.Azure.DatabaseCache` now depend on `Orchard.Azure`.

How to upgrade from a previous version
--------------------------------------

You can find migration instructions here: <http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Upgrading-a-site-to-a-new-version-of-Orchard>.

No matter what migration path you take, please take the precaution of making a backup of your
site and database first.

### Upgrading from Orchard 1.7.1 and earlier

Please follow the upgrade instruction from this document: <https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardDoc/blob/1.8/Documentation/Orchard-1-7-2-Release-Notes.markdown>

Then proceed with the upgrade steps from 1.7.2.

### Upgrading from Orchard 1.7.2

__BEFORE DOING ANYTHING PLEASE FOLLOW THIS STEPS:__

* Backup your database and your website content
* __Assign the `Administrator` role to your current Super User account__. 

You will need an account with the `Site Owner` permission before you update your website with the new release. Without this step you won't be able to access the dashboard.

In case you are discovering this notice too late, here is the manual operation to apply. In your database table `Orchard_Framework_ContentItemRecord`, on the record with `id=1` (the site content item), update the value with this content `<Data><SiteSettingsPart SuperUser="admin"/></Data>`

* Enable the Upgrade module

#### Migrating Email activities

In Orchard 1.8 the Send Email workflow activity has been replaced by a new one which is able to send emails asynchronously using the Jobs Queue.

* Click on Upgrade To 1.8 from the menu
* Select the Messaging tab and click **Migrate**

#### Migrating Infoset

In Orchard 1.8 a new data storage technique is introduced saving some of the content in the infoset document of content items instead of records. This way some records are obsolete and can be deleted. The data it contained needs to be migrated though.

* Click on Upgrade To 1.8 from the menu
* Select the Infoset tab and click on all the **Migrate** buttons one at a time

If you are not sure if one button was clicked you can try again and it will just be ignored if it was already processed.
