## Enlisting in the Source Code Using Git and Git Extensions

The Orchard project source code is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard) and can be accessed using a Git client. This page explains how to set-up your development environment. This setup allows you to work on the project as a developer, fix issues, build your own site from it or build modules.

When using a distributed source control system such as Git, it's important to understand that the latest check-in on the GitHub repository is not necessarily the one you want to download or sync to as it may be a different branch than the master branch. 

When synchronizing your enlistment, you will probably want to sync to the master branch. This is the latest stable release. Branches are [covered in more detail here](Contributing-patches#Branches).

For more information about Git, please read [Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-3.html), [Basic Branching and Merging](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) or [Git Extensions user manual](https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

### Step 1: Install Git Extensions
[Git Extensions](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions#git-extensions) is one of many Git clients available. You can access the repository using any Git client. This tutorial explains how to clone the repo with Git Extensions.

Download the [latest release directly from GitHub](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/releases/latest). You have two main options, the `Setup.msi` and the `SetupComplete.msi`. You should get the `SetupComplete.msi` version which comes with some useful extra utilities bundled with it.

Open the `msi` when it has downloaded. Follow the steps to complete the installation:

  1. **Installation Scope** Install for all users unless you don't have administrator privileges.
  2. **Required Software** Select `MsysGit` and `KDiff3`. You must have a a version of `MsysGit` installed for Git Extensions to function properly. `KDiff` is great for comparing the differences between two files or folders. You can optionally install `Windows Credential Store for Git`.
  3. **Destination Folder** Accept the default or select your preferred destination.
  4. **Custom Setup** The defaults are fine.
  5. **Select SSH Client** Choose PuTTY.

When installation has completed you will find that you have extra Git Ext options when you right click in Windows Explorer:

### Step 2: Enlist in the Source Code Using Git Extensions

In Windows Explorer, navigate to the local directory where you want your copy of the source code to live, right-click and choose `GitEx Clone`.

In the clone window you have four fields to fill out. 

  * In the `Repository to clone` field type [https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/). 
  * The `Destination` field will already be filled out with your current directory. 
  * When you paste the repository url it will also fill out the `Subdirectory to create` field. If you want to change this to a project name you can. 
  * Selecting the `Branch` dropdown will show you all of the current branches. This is loaded from GitHub so it may take a few seconds to load the list. For the latest stable branch select `master`. 

The rest of the settings can be left as-is. Click `Clone`.

You will not be prompted for your GitHub login and password unless you try to commit changes.

### Step 3: Building and Running the Orchard Source

You can build and run Orchard either from the Visual Studio, or using a command-line batch file.

#### Using Visual Studio

Open Orchard.sln from the Git enlistment directory, in `./src`. For information on the structure of the Orchard solution, see the [source code organization](Source-code-organization) page of this website.

Hit `F5` to build and run the application.

#### Without Visual Studio

Build the application from the command-line following the instructions found here: [Building and deploying Orchard from a source code drop](Building-and-deploying-Orchard-from-a-source-code-drop). You may use IIS or IIS Express to run the application.

## Everyday Git Extensions Use

The part of Git Extensions you're going to use the most is the Repository Explorer (right-click on the Git enlistment directory from the Windows Explorer to find it, it's called `GitEx Browse`). 

For example, to get the latest changes from GitHub, just click `Pull`. 

The repository explorer gives you a view of all the branching and merging that has been going on on the server. You can examine each change, read its description and view diffs. You can also right-click a change and update your local repository to it by clicking `Checkout revision`.

You can also filter by branch, which is useful for example if you're only interested in the more stable `master` branch. Development work is done in both the `1.9.x` and `dev` branches.

## Viewing the Source Code Without Enlisting

If you don't want to use Git you can still download the source code for the project. You can [download a .zip file of the source code](Manually-installing-Orchard-zip-file) but this means you don't get the advantages of being able to easily clone and update.
