Orchard simplifies the process of setting up a new website by letting you use _website recipes_. A recipe is an XML file that contains the startup configuration for an Orchard website. When you start Orchard for the first time, you can select a recipe that best matches the type of site you want to set up. For example, if you want your website to be a blog, you can select the **Blog** recipe, and much of the configuration work will be done for you.

You can create your own recipes and customize the process of setting a website and configuring Orchard features. Recipes can also instruct Orchard to download and install modules and themes from the Orchard Gallery during website setup. 

This article describes how to use recipes, how to create custom recipes, export or import recipes, and how to create a specialized distribution of Orchard using recipes. 


# Using a Recipe to Create a Website

When you first set up an Orchard website, the setup page that is displayed contains a list of recipes. You can choose a recipe to base your new website on. 

![](../Upload/screenshots/recipes_get_started.png)

The initial list contains the following recipes:

* **Default**. The default recipe for an Orchard site that includes pages, blogs, custom content types, comments, tags, widgets, and basic navigation.
* **Blog**. A recipe that provides an installation profile with features for a personal blog.
* **Core**. A recipe that provides the Orchard framework with limited end-user functionality that can be used during development.

After you choose a recipe and click **Finish Setup**, Orchard creates the website using the selected recipe and opens the home page.

# How Recipes Work

An Orchard recipe is an XML file that contains website configuration information. The following example shows the contents of the default recipe file.

    
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
	<Orchard>
	  <Recipe>
	    <Name>Default</Name>
	    <Description>The default recipe for an Orchard site that includes pages, blogs, custom content types, comments, tags, widgets and basic navigation.</Description>

The following sections of a recipe file are the elements that are most important to understand:

* **Recipe**. This section contains metadata about the recipe, such as its name and description.
* **Feature**. This section lists module features that Orchard will enable.
* **Metadata**. This section provides configuration for the types, parts, and fields that Orchard contains.
* **Settings**. This section provides a way to configure website settings.
* **Command**. This section lists commands that Orchard will run against your website in order to complete the setup. For more information about Orchard commands, see [Using the Command-line Interface](Using-the-command-line-interface).


# Creating a Custom Recipe

You can create your own recipe, which can then be added to the setup page or to your own module. Recipes added to the setup page can be selected by the user only during site setup; recipes added to a module can be executed by the user after site setup.

To get started with creating a custom recipe, you can select an existing recipe that you can tailor to your purposes. The following example shows how to start with the default recipe _(default.recipe.xml)_ and add the **Bing.Maps** module and a theme, both of which will be downloaded and enabled during setup. The recipe also creates a blog and a page that displays the map widget. Finally, the recipe adds layers and menu tabs for the blog and map page.

    
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <Orchard>
      <Recipe>
        <Name>Custom Recipe</Name>
        <Description>A recipe that includes a landing page with blog on a second tab.</Description>

Note the following about the changes made to the default recipe:

* **Module** element. This element identifies a module that will be downloaded from the Orchard Gallery on the website. This does not enable the features in the module; it only downloads it. To enable a module feature, add it to the `Feature` element as shown in the example.
* **Theme** element. This element identifies a theme that will be downloaded from the Orchard Gallery. If the **current** attribute is set to true, the theme becomes the current theme and is applied to the website. Otherwise, it will just be downloaded. It is also possible to enable a theme by using the `enable="true"` attribute. Otherwise the theme is initially disabled. If you use `current="true"`, the theme is automatically enabled.
> **Important**: The **Module** and **Theme** elements must appear in the recipe immediately after the **Recipe** element.
* **layer create** command. This was added in order to create the **Blog** and **Maps** layer.
* **blog create** command. This was added in order to create the blog.
* **page create** command. This was added in order to create the **Maps** page.
* **menuitem create** command. This was added in order to create the **Blog** and **Maps** menu tabs.

In addition to the attributes shown here for the **Module** and **Theme** elements, both elements support a **version** attribute. If the version is specified, that version will be downloaded from the Orchard Gallery. Both elements also have a **repository** attribute. By default, the **repository** attribute points to the Orchard Gallery. However, you can set it to any feed URL.

To add your custom recipe to the setup page use the `IsSetupRecipe` attribute in the `Recipe` element as shown above, and put the recipe XML file into the _Recipes_ folder (or its subfolder) of a module. Note that recipe files should have a name ending in _.recipe.xml_, e.g. _Custom.recipe.xml_. When you set up a new Orchard website, the recipe list will contain your setup recipe.

Note that recipes used for importing mustn't contain an `IsSetupRecipe` element or it should be set to `false`.

# Importing and Exporting a Recipe
Orchard enables you to import and export recipes from and to the web server. It uses the **Import Export** module, which is disabled by default. Therefore you must enable the module to use this feature.

To enable the **Import Export** module, open the dashboard and click **Modules**. On the **Modules** page, select the **Features** tab. Under **Content**, locate the **Import Export** feature and click **Enable**. A message at the top of the page will notify you when the feature is enabled. You will also see **Import/Export** listed in the dashboard feature list.  

![](../Upload/screenshots/recipe_ImportExport_enable.png)

To export a recipe, open the dashboard and click **Import/Export**. Click the **Export** tab and then choose the types, metadata, data, and settings to include in the export file. When you are finished, click **Export**.

To import a recipe, click **Import/Export** and then click the **Import** tab. Browse to the recipe file and click **Import**.

# Creating a Specialized Distribution of Orchard

Recipes simplify the process of creating a specialized distribution of Orchard. Using recipes (and optionally custom modules), you can configure a version of the Orchard platform that is optimized for nearly any type of website you can envision.

**To create a specialized distribution of Orchard**

1. Enlist in the Orchard source code. For information about how to enlist in Orchard, see [Setting Up a Source Enlistment](Setting-up-a-source-enlistment).
2. Sync to the latest build.
3. Create a custom recipe and add it to the _Orchard.Web/Modules/Orchard.Setup/Recipes_ folder. If you want your recipe to be the only option, you can remove the other recipe files.
4. Add any custom modules to the _Orchard.Web/Modules_ folder.
5. Compile the project.
6. Distribute all files under the _Orchard.Web_ folder.
