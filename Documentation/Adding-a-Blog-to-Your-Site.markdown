### Add a comment to the post

Because comments were enabled for the post, a new commented can be entered.  The comment may not appear immediately after it is submitted.  That is because Orchard has a setting which requires the site administrator to approve comments before they are published.

Return to the Orchard dashboard and under **Settings**, click **Comments**. There are two options which effect how comments are handled. One to require administrator approval before a comment is published, and another option for enabling spam protection. For more details about these features, see the [Moderating Comments](Moderating-comments) topic.

### Using Tags in blogs

Orchard provides the ability to browse content by the tags that are added to the content. Click one of the tags (for example, "Orchard") in the blog post to see a list of all content that has that tag.  For more information about managing tags, see [Organizing Content with Tags](Organizing-content-with-tags).

Notice the URL for browsing tagged content as well.

If the URL is shortened to just the _/Tags/_ portion, the list of tags used in your site is displayed.
