Content items in Orchard can be categorized with tags, and the list of items tagged with a given keyword are accessible via a front-end ~/tags/_tag-name_ URL. The browser navigates to the URL for a particular tag when that tag is selected by the user.

To edit the global list of tags in your site, go to the **Manage Tags** screen in the Orchard dsahboard by selecting **Tags** from the navigation section.

Here you can edit the tag keywords and remove tags. When you remove a tag, it is removed from all content items that share that tag. When you edit a tag, it updates all content items with that tag to the new keyword.  You can also collapse tags by renaming a tag to the same name as another tag.  This is useful for cleaning up your tags so that they are consistent throughout your site.
