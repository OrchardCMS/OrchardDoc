The Orchard documentation is built in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
We use a few simple conventions to ensure a homogeneous style throughout the full set of documents.

# File Name And Title

The document should not specify its own title as part of the document itself, but its file name should be the document title, with spaces replaced by dashes (-).
The title will be added by the site dynamically, from the file name.

# Structure

Topics should begin with a brief summary explaining what audience it targets and their key takeaways.
This summary will be displayed in search results, so it should make sense by itself.
It should consist of one paragraph of text, without a leading title.

If the topic is not complete enough to fulfill its goals, the top of the document should specify `> Draft topic` on the first line.

After the summary, the actual contents of the document should all be under section headers,
and the top section headers should be in header 1 style: `# This Is A Top Header`.
Headers should use capital letters to begin each word (see [capitalization][capitalization]).
[capitalization]: #Capitalization

Subsections should be one level deeper than their parent section.

Do use explicitly named anchors when building links to a specific section of the document.
Anchors are automatically created for all headers from their title by removing spaces.
Anchors can be linked to using the following syntax:

    [How To Build Awesome Documentation][link1]
    [link1]: #HowToBuildAwesomeDocumentation

If the anchor is in another document, use the file name and the anchor name like this:

    [Follow this link to learn how to build awesome documentation][link1]
    [link1]: name-of-the-linked-document#HowToBuildAwesomeDocumentation

Please note that anchor names are case-sensitive.

The text within a section should be structured in short paragraphs. Don't forget to include an empty line in wiki markup between paragraphs.

# Markup and Styles

Topics should use standard [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and should avoid inline HTML, including styles.

## Bolding And Italics

Do not use header styles for emphasis.

Use `*surrounding asterisks*` for *emphasis*, which will be rendered as italics.

Use `**double asterisks**` for **strong emphasis**, which will be rendered as bold.

> Use `> angle bracket paragraphs` to highlight a whole paragraph.

## Code

Inline code should be surrounded by `` `ticks` ``, and multi-line code samples should be in paragraphs indented with 4 spaces.

    This is a code block

Try to break code lines so that the code blocks do not have horizontal scroll bars.

### Escaping Markdown

If you need to use sequences of characters in your text that would normally be parsed as wiki markup, such as \`, \* or \_
but that you want to appear as they are without being parsed, add a backlash (\\) in front or surround those sequences with
code delimiters (\`). You can look at the source of this document (click the edit link in the sidebar) for many examples of this.

The list of characters that can be escaped can be found [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#backslash).

## Images

Images should not be wider than 675 pixels if they are going to be embedded into a topic.
Wider images are acceptable as targets of a link from a page.
The link to such a wide image should itself be a 675 pixel-wide thumbnail of the image.
When including a large image, do it as a 675 pixels wide image linking to the high-resolution version.
Images narrower than 675 pixels should be included with their natural width and should not be enlarged.

Images should be checked into [github](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardDoc/tree/master/Attachments), in 
a subdirectory of the Attachments directory that has the same name as the topic's markdown file.
If the image exists in small and large versions, the small one should be named the same as the full resolution, but prefixed with "s_".

The typical markup to include an image is as follows:

    ![Caption for my image](../Attachments/Name-Of-Topic/NameOfImage.png)
    
If the image is a link to a higher resolution, the link and image syntaxes must be combined:

    [![Caption](../Attachments/Topic/NameOfImage.png)][img1]
    [img1]: ../Attachments/Topic/NameOfImage.png


Acceptable image formats are PNG, JPG and GIF. Images should be reasonably compressed.
Avoid JPG for screenshots, and reserve it for photos.

## Links

References to other topics on this wiki can be made using:

    [Text for the link](Topic-Name)

Or:

    [Text for the link][ref1]
    [ref1]: Topic-Name

Links to external content can be added using:
    
    [Text for the link](http://somesite/somepage)

Or:

    [Text for the link][ref1]
    [ref1]: http://somesite/somepage

If you are using the reference syntax, the references may be grouped at the end of the document, separating the link itself from the reference definition.

Do use links to specific sections of a document where relevant (see the [structure section][structure]).
[structure]: #Structure

## Capitalization

In topic titles and in section headings, use title-style capitalization (as opposed to sentence style).
When referring to UI elements, follow the capitalization style used in the UI elements themselves. 

## Tables

Tables should be built to fit into the standard width of pages on this site.
The markup to create a table is a common extension for Markdown:

```
Header A | Header B | Header C
-------- | -------- | --------
Cell A.1 | Cell B.1 | Cell C.1
Cell A.2 | Cell B.2 | Cell C.2
Cell A.3 | Cell B.3 | Cell C.3
```

This markup will create the following table:

Header A | Header B | Header C
-------- | -------- | --------
Cell A.1 | Cell B.1 | Cell C.1
Cell A.2 | Cell B.2 | Cell C.2
Cell A.3 | Cell B.3 | Cell C.3

For details of table syntax see [Markdown Extra Tables Reference](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#table).
