In Orchard, a widget is a fragment of UI (such as HTML) and code (such as a content part) that can be easily mapped to any location or zone in the active theme, such as a sidebar or footer zone.  Examples of widgets include navigation menus, image galleries, ads, videos, and tag clouds.

This article explains the basics of widgets and shows you how to manage them.

# Layers, Zones, and Widgets
In Orchard, you manage widgets by clicking **Widgets** in the dashboard. The **Widgets** screen lists the available widgets and lets you assign the widget to a _layer_ and a _zone_. 

You can think of a _layer_ as a set of rules for displaying a widget (or group of widgets). For example, a layer might display a widget on a specific page only if the user is logged in. A _zone_ helps to position a widget on a page. 

The following image shows the **Widgets** screen.

## Available Widgets
Whenever a widget becomes available (usually by enabling another feature in the **Features** tab on the **Modules** screen of the dashboard), Orchard adds it to the list of available widgets that can be added to zones in the current theme. To see the list of widgets available in a zone, in the **Widgets** screen, click the **Add** button on one of the listed zones. 

For example, in the **Widgets** screen click **Add** for the **Header** zone. A screen is displayed that allows you to choose one of the available widgets.

The following table describes the widgets that are available by default in Orchard: 

Widget                | Description
--------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------
**Blog Archives**     | Displays a list of archived entries for the specified blog.
**Container Widget**  | Displays a "contained" content item, such as a list.
**Html Widget**       | Displays HTML content, which is entered using the widget's editor.
**Recent Blog Posts** | Displays a list of recent posts for the specified blog.

## List of Layers
Orchard comes with a number of layers already defined. You can define additional layers as needed, as discussed later in [Adding a Layer](#AddingALayer). In the **Widgets** screen, you can edit the existing layers by selecting a layer in the **Current Layer** drop-down list, or you can add new layers by clicking **Add a new layer**. 

The following table lists the default layers, shows the rule that defines the layer, and describes the effect of the layer.

Layer          | Rule              | Description
-------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------
Default        | true              | Always displayed on every page.
Authenticated  | authenticated     | Displayed if the user is authenticated.
Anonymous      | not authenticated | Displayed if the user is anonymous.
Disabled       | false             | Not displayed. This layer is provided as way to save the configuration of widgets that are not currently displayed.
TheHomepage    | url("~/")         | Displayed on the home page.

## List of Zones
In Orchard, a web page is divided into zones (regions). The available zones are defined by the website's theme. In the **Widgets** screen, you can see the list of all zones available for the currently selected layer. The list also shows the widgets assigned to each zone for the selected layer.

For information about the zones that are available in the default theme (TheThemeMachine), see [Customizing the Default Theme](Customizing-the-default-theme).


# Adding a Layer
To add a layer, in the dashboard, click **Widgets**. On the **Widgets** screen, click **Add a new layer**. The **Add Layer** screen is displayed:

![](../Upload/screenshots_675/widgets_AddLayer_1_675.png)

To define the new layer, enter the name of the layer, a description, and the rule that defines the layer. When you're finished, click **Save**.

The **Layer Rule** value is an expression that resolves to either **true** or **false**. If it resolves to **true**, the widget is displayed; otherwise the widget is not displayed. 

The following table summarizes the syntax for building layer rules.

Rule Syntax                  | Description
---------------------------- | ------------------------------
url("&lt;url&nbsp;path&gt;") | True if the current URL matches the specified path. If you add an asterisk (*) to the end of the path, all pages found in subfolders under that path will evaluate to true (for example, `url("~/home*")`).
authenticated                | True if the user is logged in.
not                          | Logical NOT.
and                          | Logical AND.
or                           | Logical OR.

Your expression can use parentheses.

For example, the following expression defines a rule that displays a widget on the **About** page if the user is not authenticated, or on any page if the user is authenticated. 

    
    (not authenticated and url("~/about")) or authenticated


To allow multiple URL values, you can use the () syntax:

    
    url("~/foo") or url("~/bar")


# Assigning a Widget to a Zone
To assign a widget to a zone, click the **Add** button on a zone that you want to add the widget to, and then select the widget to add.  

For example, click **Add** on the Header zone, and then in the **Choose A Widget** screen click the **Html Widget**.  

The **Add A Widget** screen is displayed.

The fields you need to fill in depend on the widget you're configuring. However, all widgets have **Zone**, **Layer**, **Title**, and **Position** fields. The **Position** field determines the relative position of all widgets within the zone (in effect, z-order). Keep in mind that the widgets within the zone can come from multiple layers. For example, two different layers might have widgets assigned to the same zone.

The value of the **Position** field can be an integer or a sequence of integers separated by dots. For example, the following values are all valid: 5, 10.1, 7.5.3.1. Widgets with lower position values will be rendered before those with higher values.

After setting the values of all fields, click **Save**.

# Editing or Deleting a Widget
To edit or delete a widget, in the **Widgets** screen, use the **Current Layer** drop-down list to select the layer that the widget is assigned to. In the list of zones displayed for the layer, click the widget you want to edit. The **Edit Widget** screen is displayed:

![](../Upload/screenshots_675/widgets_Delete_1_675.png)

Edit the field you want to change, then click **Save**. To remove the widget from the zone, click **Delete**.
